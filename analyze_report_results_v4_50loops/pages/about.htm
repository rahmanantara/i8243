<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -1in"><span style="color: navy">The
STDF Examinator is a free software tool from Galaxy. This product is royalty
free, and does<br>
not require a maintenance contract! You can run this software as long as you
respect the<br>
<a href="license.htm">license terms</a>. We recommend that you
periodically visit our web
site for the latest release! Our<br>
engineers keep adding new <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">must have</span></b>
features! Don't forget it is free, so just visit our web site to<br>
get the&nbsp;latest version<br>
<br>
Understanding the <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Release expiration date</span></b>:
you may have noticed that the STDF Examinator<br>
<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">About</span></i> box displays an expiration
date. This behavior has been designed to ensure you will visit our<br>
web site in the near future to get the release updates, and benefit from all the
improvements! If you<br>
don't have easy access to the Internet, ask someone else to download the release
for you ... this is<br>
not a license breach as long as you notify us by email once you have installed
the new release<br>
(simply send us an email with your name, company name, and company Email
address).&nbsp;Although<br>
the STDF examinator software is free, Galaxy still incurs a significant cost for
its enhancement and<br>
support. We believe this expiration date is a fair mechanism to allow us keep an
accurate database<br>
of users, while letting you enjoy a free, powerful, and easy to use STDF tool.
The expiration date&nbsp;<br>
typically runs for 6 months to 1 year from the date it is released to our web
site...so the worst-case<br>
scenario is that you will have to download two new releases in a year</span><span style="COLOR: navy; mso-color-alt: windowtext"><o:p>
